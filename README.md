## Function : Convert vmate files into valid date time format

    -. Current Snoppa vmate creates file name with colon(:) and timezone is not local.
    -. Some video play app in android phone can NOT understand this colon, and spit out that video 
    -. This app will copy vmate media files into Camera Folder with more proper name.
    -. You need to set your timezone before starting copy (by clicking clock icon)

## How to operate

    -. When this app is loaded, it will display all the file list you downloaded from vmate app.
    -. First thing you should do is clicking clock icon and set your time difference
     (e.g. 9 for Korea, -8 for L.A.). 
    -. After setting, you may check both files displayed in heading area
    -. If ready, click copy icon, then copying will be started while displaying current file name.
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;from : \Vmate\sd/DCIM/100HSCAM
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to : DCIM\vmate

## Notice

    -. No guarantee for improving functions
    -. This app copies vmate file into camera folder not renaming itself
    -. This app will be gone when snoppa vmate gives proper file name.

## Remarks

    Sorry but only available in **android** play store
